Rage:
You gain the Rage action, which lets you fly into a frenzy.<br />
Actions: 1<br />
Traits: Barbarian, Concentrate, Emotion, Mental<br />
<br />
Requirements: You aren’t fatigued or raging.<br />
You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging<br />
- You deal 2 additional damage with melee Strikes. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.<br />
- You take a –1 penalty to AC.<br />
- You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.<br />
After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can't Rage again for 1 minute.<br />
Instinct:
Your rage wells up from a dominant instinct—one you learned from a tradition or that comes naturally to you. Your instinct gives you an ability, requires you to avoid certain behaviors, grants you increased damage and resistances at higher levels, and allows you to select feats tied to your instinct.<br />
<br />
Animal: Instinct<br />
The fury of a wild predator fills you when you Rage, granting you ferocious unarmed attacks. Cultures that revere vicious animals (such as apes or bears) give rise to barbarians with this instinct. You might also be at war with an uncontrollable, animalistic side of your personality, or you might be a descendant of a werewolf or another werecreature. Select an animal from Table 3–3: Animal Instincts that best matches your chosen animal.<br />

- Anathema:<br />
Flagrantly disrespecting an animal of your chosen kind is anathema to your instinct, as is using weapons while raging.<br />
- Bestial Rage: (Instinct Ability)<br />
When you Rage, you gain your chosen animal's unarmed attack (or attacks). The specific attack gained, the damage it deals, and its traits are listed on Table 3–3: Animal Instincts. These attacks are in the brawling group. Your Rage action gains the morph, primal, and transmutation traits.<br />
<br />
Dragon: Instinct<br />
You summon the fury of a mighty dragon and manifest incredible abilities. Perhaps your culture reveres draconic majesty, or you gained your connection by drinking or bathing in dragon's blood or after watching a marauding wyrm burn your village. Select a type of dragon from Table 3–4: Dragon Instincts to be your instinct's dragon type. Chromatic dragons tend to be evil, and metallic dragons tend to be good.<br />

- Anathema:<br />
Letting a personal insult against you slide is anathema to your instinct. Choose whether your character respects or abhors your dragon type. If you respect it, defying such a dragon is anathema, and if you abhor it, failing to defeat such a dragon you come across is anathema.<br />
- Draconic Rage: (Instinct Ability)<br />
While raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 4 and change its damage type to match that of your dragon's breath weapon instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack. If you do this, your Rage action gains the arcane and evocation traits, as well as the trait matching the damage type.<br />
<br />
Fury: Instinct<br />
Your rage comes from a deep and purely personal well within you. You use your rage as you choose.<br />
- Anathema and Instinct Ability:<br />
You don't have an anathema or an instinct ability. Instead, you gain an additional 1st-level barbarian feat.<br />
<br />
Giant: Instinct<br />
Your rage gives you the raw power and size of a giant. This doesn't necessarily mean you revere giants—you might scoff at them or even aspire to slay them! You could instead seem like a giant to other people due to your exceptional strength or larger-than-life emotions and ego.<br />
- Anathema:<br />
Failing to face a personal challenge of strength is anathema.<br />
- Titan Mauler: (Instinct Ability)<br />
You can use a weapon built for a Large creature if you are Small or Medium (both normally and when raging). If you're not Small or Medium, you can use a weapon built for a creature one size larger than you. You gain access to this larger weapon, which can be of any weapon type otherwise available at character creation. It has the normal Price and Bulk for a weapon of its size. When wielding such a weapon in combat, increase your additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6, but you have the clumsy 1 condition because of the weapon's unwieldy size. You can't remove this clumsy condition or ignore its penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.<br />
<br />
Spirit: Instinct<br />
Whether you are emotionally sensitive to the spirits around you; worship ancestors or apparitions; or are haunted by the specter of an ancestor, relative, friend, or foe, your rage takes the form of a spiritual possession.<br />
- Anathema:<br />
Disrespecting corpses or spirits is anathema to your instinct; defending yourself against undead creatures is not.<br />
- Spirit Rage: (Instinct Ability)<br />
While raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 3 and change its damage type to negative or positive, instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack (choose each time you Rage). If you choose to deal negative or positive damage, your weapon or unarmed attack gains the effects of the ghost touch property rune, which makes it more effective against incorporeal creatures, and your Rage action gains the divine and necromancy traits, plus negative or positive, as appropriate.<br />
Occult Spellcasting:
You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the occult tradition using the Cast a Spell activity (see Casting Spells). As a bard, when you cast spells, your incantations might be musical riffs or clever limericks, your gestures might incorporate dance and dramatic pantomiming, and you might accompany your spellcasting by playing a musical instrument.<br />
<br />
Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Bard Spells per Day table.<br />
<br />
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.<br />
Spell Repertoire (Bard):
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.<br />
<br />
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Bard Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.<br />
<br />
Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.<br />
Composition Spells:
You can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects called compositions. Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.<br />
<br />
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear here.<br />
<br />
You learn the counter performance composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects.<br />
Muses:
As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things and might be someone you know, a supernatural creature, location, deity, philosophy, or captivating mystery. Depending on the type of inspiration you receive, your 1st-level muse grants you a specific 1st-level bard feat and adds a spell to your repertoire.<br />
<br />
In addition to this, each muse opens the door to many later bard feats. If one type of inspiration is not enough to represent your muse, consider the Multifarious Muse feat.<br />
<br />
Enigma: Muse<br />
Your muse is a mystery, driving you to uncover the hidden secrets of life and the multiverse. These muses can be people you cannot fully grasp, texts layered deeply with symbolism, or emotional paradoxes that underline a lifetime's work. If your muse is an otherworldly creature, it might be a mysterious aeon or an occult dragon; if a deity, it might be Irori or Nethys. Art inspired by an enigma muse could be cryptic, eerie, or laden with speculation and conspiracy.
As a bard with the enigma muse, you support your allies by providing knowledge alongside inspiration and occult support.<br />
<br />
- Muse Feat: Bardic Lore<br />
- Muse Spell: sure strike<br />
<br />
Maestro: Muse<br />
Your muse constantly inspires you to greater heights of artistic prowess. For many bards, a teacher or rival fills this role, although some set their sights higher and attempt to surpass great composers of the past or blaze a new trail entirely. If your muse is a supernatural creature, it might be one who loves to perform, such as a choral angel or a lyrakien azata; if a deity, it might be Shelyn. Art inspired by a maestro muse is precise and inventive, a formalist achievement.
As a bard with a maestro muse, you are an inspiration to your allies and confident of your musical and oratorical abilities.<br />
<br />
- Muse Feat: Lingering Composition<br />
- Muse Spell: soothe<br />
<br />
Polymath: Muse<br />
Your muse is a jack of all trades, flitting between skills and pursuits. Some bards are constantly moved by new muses or draw their inspiration from an idealized being, whether it's based on a real person or purely philosophical. If your muse is a single creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey or one who's learned a lot over a long lifespan; if a deity, it might be Desna or Calistria. Art inspired by a polymath muse is restless, with each composition exhibiting new techniques and an ever-evolving style.
As a bard with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up your mind—you want to try everything.<br />
<br />
- Muse Feat: Versatile Performance<br />
- Muse Spell: phantasmal minion<br />
Champion's Code:
You follow a code of conduct, beginning with tenets shared by all champions of an alignment (such as good), and continuing with tenets of your cause. Deities often add additional strictures (for instance, Torag’s champions can’t show mercy to enemies of their people, making it almost impossible for them to follow the redeemer cause). Tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren’t in a no-win situation; instead, follow the more important tenet. For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you’re hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to override a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting authorities) is a violation of the champion code.<br />
<br />
If you stray from your alignment or violate your code of conduct, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual, but you keep any other champion abilities that don’t require those class features. If your alignment shifts but is still one allowed by your deity, your GM might let you retrain your cause while still following the same deity.
<br />
Good: Tenets of Good<br />
- You must never perform acts anathema to your deity or willingly commit an evil act, such as murder, torture, or the casting of an evil spell.<br />
- You must never knowingly harm an innocent, or allow immediate harm to one through inaction when you know you could reasonably prevent it. This tenet doesn't force you to take action against possible harm to innocents at an indefinite time in the future, or to sacrifice your life to protect them.<br />
<br />
Evil: Tenets of Evil
The tenets and causes of evil follow the rules provided in the Core Rulebook. While evil characters in general can range from self-serving but loyal allies to the extremes of depravity, evil champions are particularly vile, with a code that requires, enforces, and depends upon their villainous behavior. This means they can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be accessible player character options only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. The tenets and causes of evil are uncommon options. While the feats and actions suitable for evil champions don't separately list access entries, typically if your GM grants you access to evil tenets, you also gain access to champion actions and feats that require those tenets.
- You must never perform acts anathema to your deity or willingly commit a purely good act, such as giving something solely out of charity, casting a good spell, or using a good item.
- You must never put another person's needs before your own, and you must never put your own needs before those of your deity. Though you can perform acts others might consider helpful, it must be done with the expectation that it ultimately furthers your own goals or those of your master.<br />
<br />
Deity And Cause:
Champions are divine servants of a deity. Choose a deity to follow; your alignment must be one allowed for followers of your deity. Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity’s ideals or alignment are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be considered anathema appear in each deity’s entry. You and your GM determine whether other acts are anathema. You have one of the following causes. Your cause must match your alignment exactly. Your cause determines your champion’s reaction, grants you a devotion spell, and defines part of your champion’s code.
<br />
Paladin: Lawful Good<br />
You’re honorable, forthright, and committed to pushing back the forces of cruelty. You gain the Retributive Strike champion’s reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these tenets:<br />
- You must act with honor, never taking advantage of others, lying, or cheating.<br />
- You must respect the lawful authority of legitimate leadership wherever you go, and follow its laws.<br />
<br />
Redeemer: Neutral Good<br />
You’re full of kindness and forgiveness. You gain the Glimpse of Redemption champion’s reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these:<br />
- You must first try to redeem those who commit evil acts, rather than killing them or meting out punishment. If they then continue on a wicked path, you might need to take more extreme measures.<br />
- You must show compassion for others, regardless of their authority or station.<br />
<br />
Liberator: Chaotic Good<br />
You’re committed to defending the freedom of others. You gain the Liberating Step champion’s reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these tenets:<br />
- You must respect the choices others make over their own lives, and you can’t force someone to act in a particular way or threaten them if they don’t.<br />
- You must demand and fight for others’ freedom to make their own decisions. You may never engage in or countenance slavery or tyranny.<br />
<br />
Deific Weapon:
You zealously bear your deity’s favored weapon. If it’s uncommon, you gain access to it. If it’s an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).<br />
Champion's Reaction:
Your cause gives you a special reaction.<br />
<br />
Paladin: Retributive Strike<br />
Actions: Reaction<br />
Traits: Champion<br />
<br />
Trigger: An enemy damages your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.<br />
<br />
You protect your ally and strike your foe. The ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. If the foe is within reach, make a melee Strike against it.<br />
<br />
Redeemer: Glimpse Of Redemption<br />
Actions: Reaction<br />
Traits: Champion<br />
<br />
Trigger: An enemy damages your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.<br />
<br />
Your foe hesitates under the weight of sin as visions of redemption play in their mind’s eye. The foe must choose one of the following options:<br />
- The ally is unharmed by the triggering damage.<br />
- The ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. After the damaging effect is applied, the enemy becomes enfeebled 2 until the end of its next turn.<br />
<br />
Liberator: Liberating Step<br />
Actions: Reaction<br />
Traits: Champion<br />
<br />
Trigger: An enemy damages, Grabs, or Grapples your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.<br />
<br />
You free an ally from restraint. If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing, restraining, immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt to Escape from one effect as a free action. If they can move, the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn’t need to escape.<br />
<br />
Devotion Spells:
Your deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.<br />
<br />
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules are found here. You gain a devotion spell depending on your cause, and you are trained in divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Charisma.<br />
Shield Block:
You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.<br />
Deity:
As a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in their entry. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.<br />
<br />
Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list, once you can prepare spells of their level as a cleric. Some of these spells aren't normally on the divine list, but they're divine spells if you prepare them this way.<br />
Divine Spellcasting:
Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a material component pouch. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.<br />
<br />
As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–9: Cleric Spells per Day on page 120.<br />
<br />
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls.<br />
Divine Font:
Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional heal or harm spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between heal or harm. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of an ethical shift or divine intervention.<br />
<br />
Healing Font: You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only heal spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.<br />
<br />
Harmful Font: You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only harm spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.<br />
Doctrine:
Even among followers of the same deity, there are numerous doctrines and beliefs, which sometimes vary wildly between clerics. At 1st level, you select a doctrine and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. The doctrines presented in this book are cloistered cleric and warpriest. Each doctrine grants you initial benefits at 1st level. At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, you gain the benefits granted by your doctrine’s second, third, fourth, fifth, and final doctrines respectively.<br />
<br />
Cloistered Cleric: Doctrine<br />
You are a cleric of the cloth, focusing on divine magic and your connection to your deity’s domains.<br />
First Doctrine (1st): You gain the Domain Initiate cleric feat.<br />
Second Doctrine (3rd): Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.<br />
Third Doctrine (7th): Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.<br />
Fourth Doctrine (11th): You gain expert proficiency with your deity's favored weapon, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using your deity's favored weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect; use your divine spell DC if necessary.<br />
Fifth Doctrine (15th): Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.<br />
Final Doctrine (19th): Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.<br />
<br />
Warpriest: Doctrine<br />
You have trained in the more militant doctrine of your church, focusing on both spells and battle.<br />
First Doctrine (1st): You’re trained in light and medium armor, and you have expert proficiency in Fortitude saves. You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction to reduce damage with a shield. If your deity’s weapon is a simple weapon or an unarmed attack, you gain the Deadly Simplicity cleric feat. At 13th level, if you gain the divine defense class feature, you also gain expert proficiency in light and medium armor.<br />
Second Doctrine (3rd): You’re trained in martial weapons.<br />
Third Doctrine (7th): You gain expert proficiency with your deity's favored weapon, martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using your deity's favored weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect; You can use your spell DC in place of your class DC.<br />
Fourth Doctrine (11th): Your proficiency ranks for the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics increase to expert.<br />
Fifth Doctrine (15th): Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.<br />
Final Doctrine (19th): You gain master proficiency with your deity's favored weapon, spell attack modifier, and spell DC.<br />
Primal Spellcasting:
The power of the wild world flows through you. You can cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a material component pouch.<br />
<br />
At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.<br />
<br />
As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–11: Druid Spells per Day.<br />
<br />
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls.<br />
Anathema:
As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities that come from the druid class, including your primal spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual.<br />
<br />
The following acts are anathema to all druids:<br />
- Using metal armor or shields.<br />
- Despoiling natural places.<br />
- Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids.<br />
<br />
Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts, detailed in the order’s entry.<br />
Druidic Language:
You know Druidic, a secret language known to only druids, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids is anathema.<br />
Druidic Order:
Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.<br />
<br />
Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.<br />
<br />
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Selecting druid feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.<br />
<br />
Animal: Druidic Order<br />
You have a strong connection to beasts, always feeling like you understood them (and they you) better than your own people. You stand for the animals of nature, a powerful animal companion at your side.<br />
- Order Skill: Athletics<br />
- Druid Feat: Animal Companion<br />
- Order Spell: Heal Animal<br />
- Anathema: Commit wanton cruelty to animals or kill animals unnecessarily. (This doesn’t prevent you from defending yourself against animals or killing them cleanly for food).<br />
<br />
Leaf: Drudic Order<br />
You revere the bounty of nature, acting as both a gardener and warden for the wilderness. With your leshy familiar at your side, you help areas regrow after disasters or negligent expansion and turn flora against those who would abuse them.<br />
- Order: Skill Diplomacy<br />
- Druid Feat: Leshy Familiar<br />
- Order Spell: Cornucopia<br />
- Anathema: Commit wanton cruelty to plants or fungi or kill them unnecessarily. (This doesn’t prevent you from defending yourself or harvesting them for survival.)<br />
<br />
Wild: Druidic Order<br />
The uncontrollable call of the natural world courses through your body. You might have been raised by a wild animal, or you might have come to reject the artifices of cities after growing up in one. Now, primal magic grants you the ability to wear the form of an untamed creature.<br />
- Order Skill: Intimidation<br />
- Druid Feat: Wild Shape<br />
- Order Spell: Untamed Shift<br />
- Anathema: Become fully domesticated by the temptations of civilization. (This doesn’t prevent you from buying and using processed goods or staying in a city for an adventure, but you can never come to rely on these conveniences or truly call such a place your permanent home.)<br />
Wild Empathy:
You have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on animals and to make very simple Requests of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case.<br />
Attack Of Opportunity:
Ever watchful for weaknesses, you can quickly attack foes that leave an opening in their defenses. You gain the Attack of Opportunity reaction.<br />
<br />
Actions: Reaction<br />
<br />
Trigger: A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it’s using.<br />
<br />
You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.<br />
Flurry Of Blows:
You can attack rapidly with fists, feet, elbows, knees, and other unarmed attacks. You gain the Flurry of Blows action.<br />
<br />
Actions: 1<br />
Traits: Flourish, Monk<br />
<br />
Make two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. As it has the flourish trait, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn.<br />
Powerful Fist:
You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4. Most people take a –2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because they find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don't take this penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks.<br />
Hunt Prey:
When you focus your attention on a single foe, you become unstoppable in your pursuit. You gain the Hunt Prey action.<br />
<br />
Actions: 1<br />
Traits: Concentrate, Ranger<br />
<br />
You designate a single creature as your prey and focus your attacks against that creature. You must be able to see or hear the prey, or you must be tracking the prey during exploration.<br />
<br />
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when you Seek your prey and a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you Track your prey. You also ignore the penalty for making ranged attacks within your second range increment against the prey you’re hunting.<br />
<br />
You can have only one creature designated as your prey at a time. If you use Hunt Prey against a creature when you already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new prey gains the designation. Your designation lasts until your next daily preparations.<br />
Hunter's Edge:
You have trained for countless hours to become a more skilled hunter and tracker, gaining an additional benefit when you Hunt Prey depending on the focus of your training. Choose a hunter’s edge.<br />
<br />
Flurry: Hunter's Edge<br />
You have trained to unleash a devastating flurry of attacks upon your prey. Your multiple attack penalty for attacks against your hunted prey is –3 (–2 with an agile weapon) on your second attack of the turn instead of –5, and –6 (–4 with an agile weapon) on your third or subsequent attack of the turn, instead of –10.<br />
<br />
Outwit: Hunter's Edge<br />
You are talented at outwitting and evading your prey. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks, Intimidation checks, Stealth checks, and any checks to Recall Knowledge about the prey, and a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against your prey's attacks.<br />
<br />
Precision: Hunter's Edge<br />
You have trained to aim for your prey’s weak points. The first time you hit your hunted prey in a round, you also deal 1d8 additional precision damage. (Precision damage increases the damage you already deal, using the same type, but is ineffective against creatures that lack vital organs or weak points.) At 11th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8 precision damage, and at 19th level, the extra damage increases to 3d8 precision damage.<br />
Rogue's Racket:
As you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities. Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases. Choose a rogue’s racket.<br />
<br />
Ruffian: Rogue's Racket<br />
You prefer the direct approach: strong-arming or intimidation. You might be an enforcer for organized crime, a highway bandit, or a noble who bullies others with threats of your family's power.<br />
You use whatever tools you have at hand to get the job done. You can deal sneak attack damage with any weapon, not just the weapons listed in the sneak attack class feature. This benefit doesn't apply to a simple weapon with a damage die greater than d8 or a martial or advanced weapon with a damage die greater than d6. (Apply any abilities that alter the damage die size first.) Critical hits you make with these weapons gain the weapon's critical specialization benefit if the target is off-guard to you.<br />
<br />
You're trained in Intimidation and medium armor. You can choose Strength as your key ability score. When you gain light armor expertise, you also gain expert proficiency in medium armor, and when you gain light armor mastery, you also gain master proficiency in medium armor.<br />
<br />
Scoundrel: Rogue's Racket<br />
You use fast-talking, flattery, and a silver tongue to avoid danger and escape tricky situations. You might be a grifter or con artist, or you might use your skills in certain reputable professions, like a barrister or diplomat<br />
<br />
When you successfully Feint, the target is off-guard against your melee attacks until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, the target is off-guard against all melee attacks until the end of your next turn, not just yours. If you Feint while wielding an agile or finesse melee weapon, you can step immediately after the Feint as a free action.<br />
<br />
You’re trained in Deception and Diplomacy. You can choose Charisma as your key ability score.<br />
<br />
Thief: Rogue's Racket<br />
Nothing beats the thrill of taking something that belongs to someone else, especially if you can do so completely unnoticed. You might be a pickpocket working the streets, a cat burglar sneaking through windows, or even a consultant, testing clients’ vaults for openings.<br />
<br />
When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight weapons, and you strike where it hurts. When you attack with a finesse melee weapon or finesse melee unarmed attack, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.<br />
<br />
You are trained in Thievery.<br />
Sneak Attack:
When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.<br />
<br />
As your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.<br />
Surprise Attack:
You spring into combat faster than foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven’t acted are flat-footed to you.<br />
Bloodline:
Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you learn, and additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.<br />

- Elemental Type: Choose the type of elemental that influenced your bloodline: air, earth, fire, or water. If your element is air, you buffet your foes with powerful winds; if it's earth, you toss huge chunks of rock; if it's fire, you incinerate your foes with flame; and if it's water, you inundate your foes with torrents of water. For fire, all marked spells deal fire damage. For other elements, they deal bludgeoning damage. You replace any existing elemental traits with the trait of the element you chose.<br />

Sorcerer Spellcasting:
Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a material component pouch.<br />
<br />
Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.<br />
<br />
As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3–17: Sorcerer Spells per Day.<br />
<br />
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls.<br />
Spell Repertoire (Sorcerer):
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.<br />
<br />
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3–17), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-level version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.<br />
<br />
Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.<br />
Arcane Spellcasting:
Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells).<br />
<br />
At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.<br />
<br />
As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 3–19: Wizard Spells per Day.<br />
<br />
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls.<br />
Arcane School:
Many arcane spellcasters delve deeply into a single school of magic in an attempt to master its secrets. If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.<br />
Abjuration: Arcane School
As an abjurer, you master the art of proterction, strengthening defenses, preventing attacks, and even turning magic against itself.
- You add one 1st-level abjuration spell to your spellbook.
- You learn the protective ward school spell.

Conjuration: Arcane School
As a conjurer, you summon creatures and objects from places beyond, and use magic to transport to distant locales.
- You add one 1st-level conjuration spell to your spellbook.
- You learn the augment summoning school spell.

Divination: Arcane School
As a diviner, you master remote viewing and prescience, learning information that can transform investigations, research, and battle strategies.
- You add one 1st-level divination spell to your spellbook.
- You learn the diviner's sight school spell.

Enchantment: Arcane School
As an enchanter, you use magic to manipulate others' minds. You might use your abilities to subtly influence others or seize control over them.
- You add one 1st-level enchantment spell to your spellbook.
- You learn the charming words school spell.

Evocation: Arcane School
As an evoker, you revel in the raw power of magic, using it to create and destroy with ease. You can call forth elements, forces, and energy to devastate your foes or to assist you in other ways.
- You add one 1st-level evocation spell to your spellbook.
- You learn the force bolt school spell.

Illusion: Arcane School
As an illusionist, you use magic to create images, figments, and phantasms to baffle your enemies. You understand that perception is realitly.
- You add one 1st-level illusion spell to your spellbook.
- You learn the warped terrain school spell.

Necromancy: Arcane School
As a necromancer, you call upon the powers of life and death. While your school is often vilified for its association with raising the undead, you understand that control over life also means control over healing.
- You add one 1st-level necromancy spell to your spellbook.
- You learn the call of the grave school spell.

Transmutation: Arcane School
As a transmuter, you alter physical properties of things, transforming creatures, objects, the natural world, and even yourself at your whim. You understand that change is inevitable.
- You add one 1st-level transmutation spell to your spellbook.
- You learn the physical boost school spell.
<br />
If you don’t choose a school, you’re a universalist, a wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater fiexibility.<br />
Universalist:<br />
- For each level of wizard spell slots you have, you can use Drain Bonded Item once per day to recall a spell od that level (Instead of using it only once per day in total).
- You gain an extra wizard class feat, and you add one 1st-level spell of your choice to your spellbook.

Arcane Bond:
You place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.<br />
<br />
Actions: Free Action<br />
Traits: Arcane, Wizard<br />
<br />
Frequency: once per day<br />
<br />
You expend the power stored in your bonded item, as long as the item is on your person. During your turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell's other requirements.<br />
Arcane Thesis:
During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like “On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.”<br />
<br />
Experimental Spellshaping: Arcane Thesis<br />
Your thesis posits that the magical practice of spellshaping can be realized more efficiently by altering variables and parameters as you cast, imitating the wizards of long ago who had to work out their own spells themselves. This allows you efficient access to various spellshape effects.<br />
You gain one 1st-level spellshape wizard feat of your choice. Starting at 4th level, during your daily preparations, you can gain a spellshape wizard feat of your choice that has a level requirement of no more than half your level, which you can use until your next daily preparations.<br />
<br />
Spell Blending: Arcane Thesis<br />
You theorize that spell slots are a shorthand for an underlying energy that powers all spellcasting, and you've found a way to tinker with the hierarchy of spell slots, combining them to fuel more powerful spells.<br />
During your daily preparations, you can trade two spell slots of the same spell rank for a bonus spell slot of up to 2 spell ranks higher than the traded spell slots. You can exchange as many spell slots as you have available. Bonus spell slots must be of a spell rank you can normally cast, and each bonus spell slot must be of a different spell rank. You can also trade any spell slot for two additional cantrips, though you can't trade more than one spell slot at a time for additional cantrips in this way.<br />
<br />
Staff Nexus: Arcane Nexus<br />
Your thesis maintains that early and intense adoption of staves from the first days of study can create a symbiotic bond between spellcaster and staff, allowing them to create remarkable magic together. You've formed such a connection with a makeshift staff you built, and you are ready to infuse any staff you encounter with greater power.<br />
You begin play with a makeshift staff of your own invention. It has the magical trait and contains one cantrip and one 1st-rank spell, both from your spellbook. During your daily preparations, you can expend one spell to grant the staff a number of charges equal to that spell's rank, which dissipate after 24 hours. While you are holding the staff, you can Cast the Spells it contains. The 1st-rank spell consumes 1 charge but the cantrip doesn't require charges.<br />
You can Craft your makeshift staff into any other type of magical staff for the new staff's usual cost, adding the two spells you originally chose to the staff you Craft. This staff gains charges from preparing it along with expended spells.<br />
At 8th level, you can expend two spells instead of one when preparing any staff, adding additional charges equal to the combined ranks of the expended spells. At 16th level, you can expend up to a total of three spells to add charges to the staff, adding additional charges equal to the combined ranks of all three spells.<br />
<br />
Deny Advantage:
Your foes struggle to pass your defenses. You aren’t flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.<br />
Lightning Reflexes:
Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank in Reflex saves increases to expert.<br />
Signature Spells:
Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.<br />
Divine Ally:
Your devotion attracts a spirit of your deity's alignment. Once you choose an ally, your choice can't be changed.<br />
<br />
The following are divine allies:<br />
<br />
Blade Ally: A spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune and you also gain the weapon's critical specialization effect. For a champion following the tenets of good, choose disrupting, ghost touch, returning, or shifting. For a champion following the tenets of evil, choose fearsome, returning, or shifting.<br />
<br />
Shield Ally: A spirit of protection dwells within your shield. In your hands, the shield's Hardness increases by 2 and its HP and BT increase by half.<br />
<br />
Steed Ally: You gain a young animal companion as a mount. Ordinarily, your animal companion is one that has the mount special ability, such as a horse. You can select a different animal companion (GM's discretion), but this ability doesn't grant it the mount special ability.<br />
Alertness:
You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.<br />
Great Fortitude:
Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.<br />
Bravery:
Having faced countless foes and the chaos of battle, you have learned how to stand strong in the face of fear and keep on fighting. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you roll a success at a Will save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, anytime you gain the frightened condition, reduce its value by 1.<br />
Incredible Movement:
You move like the wind. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed whenever you’re not wearing armor. The bonus increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels you have beyond 3rd.<br />
Mystic Strikes:
Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks become magical, allowing them to get past resistances to non-magical attacks. However, you still need an item such as handwraps of mighty blows to gain an item bonus to attack rolls or increase your attacks' weapon damage dice.<br />
