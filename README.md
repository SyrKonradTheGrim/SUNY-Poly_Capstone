The file is supposed to come with an installer that way you only need to run the installerand everything will download.
Github does not allow files over 100MB to be uploaded so the only way to run the program is to download all of these files and run the javachatractercreator.java file in a Java IDE from the file path:
...\PathfinderCharacterCreator\src\main\java\com\example\pathfindercharactercreator

This is not how the program is meant to be accessed and the installer can be found here: https://mega.nz/file/VMIGhBZC#d6MtE8Gd03abFDIANk0ZE6s4BajLUdoVZ530S60sBKY
